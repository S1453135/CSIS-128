<h1>The Emperor's New Groove</h1>
<p>Spoiled and foolish, Emperor Kuzco gets on the wrong side of his 
ambitious former advisor Yzma (secretly a sorceress of sorts) and is 
turned into a llama.  To become human again, he must sneak back into 
his (now Yzma's) palace, but his only help is Pacha - a peasant whose 
village he had been planning to dismantle.  What follows is a silly-
funny adventure, true to Disney fashion, involving shoulder angels and 
devils, a diner in the middle of the jungle, and an evil kitten.</p>
<p>This movie ranks in my favorite films mostly because of the fun 
and memories associated with it.  My college roommates and I used it 
as a post-prelim exam de-stressor.  While the prelims were terrible, 
the movies were good, and we all just needed to laugh.</p>
