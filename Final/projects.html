<p>With any farm comes lots of work.  Our property came with perimeter fencing, in various shades of 
sturdiness; a good cow barn with a small pasture around it (maybe a half-acre); and a well for stock 
water.  It also featured a pond, two streams, and a second well and shed in the "back pasture" 
(approximately seven acres).</p>
<p>Our livestock goals were cattle, goats, and poultry.  The barn was suitable for cows, though lots 
more fence would be needed --for instance, there was insufficient fence to cross the cows from the pasture 
by the barn, across one stream, and to the back pasture.  Meanwhile, there was nowhere for goats to live, 
and with our proximity to Smithville Lake and the Corps of Engineers land, we were concerned about predators, 
especially since the barn is not right near the house.</p>
<p>So began our many projects to repair and improve what we had and construct what we needed.  We got lots 
of inspiration and guidance from Margaret's network of farmer friends, as well as the wonders of the 
Internet.  In addition to chronicling our work for our own sake, we hope that our guides and project 
descriptions here might help someone else!</p>
