<h1>Puscifer</h1>
<p>A slightly raunchy, odd collection of musicians led by Maynard
James Keenan, who also leads Tool and A Perfect Circle.</p>
<h3>Members</h3>
<p>While the membership is described by Wikipedia as a revolving door, 
the group includes Maynard James Keenan (vocals), Carina Round (vocals, 
guitar, banjitar, and tambourine), Mat Mitchell (guitar), Paul Barker (bass), 
Jeff Friedl (drums and electronic samples), and Masha Zargaran (keyboards, samples, 
guitar, and backup vocals).</p>
<h3>Sample of Discography</h3>
<ul><li><i>"V" Is for Vagina</i>, the debut album of the group in 2007.</li>
<li><i>Conditions of My Parole</i>, released in 2011, featuring collaborations of 
Keenan and 15 other artists.</li>
<li><i>Money Shot</i>, released in 2015, featuring more vocal work by Carina
 Round than previously, and a noticeable desert theme.  "Grand Canyon" is an excellent track.</li>
