<h2>The Cows</h2>
<p>Margaret fell in love with cows while interning at a beef operation in Upstate NY years ago, and decided that a few beefers were definitely in her future.  After meeting and working with all sorts of cattle, she settled on Scottish Highlanders because of their hardiness, gentle temperaments, and crazy good looks.  Luckily, Eric liked them just fine as well.</p>
<section>
<h3>About the breed</h3>
<p>Information gleaned from <a href="https://livestockconservancy.org/index.php/heritage/internal/highland">The Livestock Conservancy</a> and <a href="http://www.heartlandhighlandcattleassociation.org/">The Heartland Highland Cattle Association</a>.</p>
<p><h4>Origins</h4>Highland Cattle originated in the Highlands of Scotland, as the name suggests.  They were, and are, known for their good tempers, ability to get by with less-than-ideal forage, resistance to the cold, and good mothering.  The official Herd Book was started in the late 1800s, and the first animals were brought into the US in the late 1890s.  There are now Herd Books in the US, UK, and various EU countries.  While not one of the common breeds of beef cattle in the US, they are given a "watch" status by the Livestock Conservancy, due to the relatively low numbers of animals and threats to genetic purity in the EU, where 3/4 Highlands may be registered as purebred.</p>
<p><h4>Appearance</h4>Highlanders are most often light red, but may be brown, black, brindle, silver, grey, dun, or cream.  Only solid-colored animals may be shown, however.  The cattle have long, shaggy outer coats with a softer inner coat - the source of their cold hardiness.  They are a horned breed, though the horns are mostly for scratching themselves, knocking down brush, and chasing off predators.</p>
<p><h4>Beef Production</h4>As a smaller breed of cattle - mature cows will weigh 900-1200lb, compared to 1100-1300lb for a black Angus - and predominantly a forager, Highland cattle take longer to reach mature weight than many beef breeds bred for rapid weight gain.  However, their meat is said to be tender and flavorful.  Because of their double-haircoat, Highlanders don't put on the subcutaneous layer of fat that most other breeds develop for warmth.  Thus, a finished Highlander will have marbing and tenderness without the excessive trim one would see on an Angus.</p>

<h3>Our herd</h3>
<p>The herd foundation is three cows Margaret purchased in November 2015: a three-year-old, 1/4-Angus cow named Gabby; her heifer calf from that spring, named Grendel; and a purebred red two-year-old named Red.  The cows were already fairly tame; they were accustomed to rotational grazing so weren't shy of people, and also knew that people tend to bring range cubes as treats.  Getting them to accept their new owners was as simple as daily bribes.</p>
<p>The herd grew the following spring, as both Red and Gabby had been bred to a purebred Highland bull before purchase.  Red delivered a red heifer calf, Ruaidh (roo-ee, 'red' in Scots Gaelic), but they got confused somewhere in there and the calf had to be bottle-raised.  Gabby delivered a bull calf (#602) shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>At least temporarily, the herd contains another visitor, a Jersey calf named Quincy.  Ruaidh needed a buddy, growing up separate from the rest of the herd, so Margaret's employer bought a calf that that farm will keep.</p>

<h3>Management and grazing</h3>
<p>As mentioned, Highland cattle are good foragers and kept mostly where the grazing gets rough.  They can tolerate low-quality forage, will graze some non-grass species (unlike most cows), and will graze in almost any weather.  This makes them ideal candidates for grass-fed/grass-finished/pastured beef. There are not many strict definitions of grass-fed or grass-finished, so here's how we do raise and plan to continue raising our cattle: the animals always have access to forage; hay may be supplemented during the winter (especially since Margaret boards some other animals on the farm who cannot be trusted on our big pastures, and we don't yet have the facilities to keep them separately).  The cows get 'treats' almost daily: usually a handful of range cubes (made of forage and grain byproducts; a good protein, vitamin, and mineral supplement and an excellent bribe), sometimes some corn or alfalfa pellets - depends on what we have around.  Treating the animals like this ensures that they stay close to home, come when we call, and it gives us a chance to check on them easily every day.  It's been suggested that grain in the diet doesn't affect the fat or meat quality of cattle until it constitutes over 7% of the animal's diet.  The cows get perhaps 1/2lb of cubes apiece daily; meanwhile their daily forage intake is approximately 30lb for every 1000lb of body weight.  We consider it well worth the tradeoff of not being able to claim 100% grass-fed...98.33% works for us.</p>
<p>There is a growing movement for chemical-free beef (and pork, and chicken, etc).  We are striving for sound management practices, like rotational grazing, that keep fly numbers low and contribute to healthy cows.  But we do treat animals when they are sick, and vaccinate for common preventable diseases (blackleg, respiratory diseases, leptospirosis).  Our fly spray use is minimal - a side benefit of the shaggy Highland coats is that flies have a hard time bothering them - but after a few pinkeye cases this summer, we do use a pour-on when things get really nasty.</p>
<p>As always, questions and comments are welcome - we encourage anyone concerned about livestock management to ask and learn!  Visit the contact page to get in touch with any questions or concerns.</p>

<h3>Goals for the future</h3>
<p>While Red and Ruaidh are purebred Highlanders, it is unlikely we will continue to breed straight Highland.  To get faster-growing calves with a bit more heat tolerance, Margaret wants to crossbreed, probably with Angus bulls.  That said, if there is interest or demand for purebred Highlanders, we will consider going that direction.  We've done some work to construct a chute system that could facilitate artificial insemination, which would greatly increase our options for bulls - otherwise we'll either need to borrow or buy a bull, or board the girls somewhere else.  This said, Margaret thinks the brindle Highlanders look neat, so one of those might be in the future...</p>
<p>As a hobby farm, the cows are "productive pets."  Our goal is to supply ourselves and family with beef, and perhaps sell some halves or quarters as our stocking capacity goes up.  As we get more work done on the farm and fencing, the cattle will be able to graze more and more of the land we own.  Ultimately, Margaret estimates that the farm can support four or five cows with calves at side, plus the calves from the year before who are approaching finishing weight - so perhaps 12-15 cattle.</p>
