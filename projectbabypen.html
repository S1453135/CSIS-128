<p>Every now and again, one of the critters needs some TLC.  During really bad weather, this might mean a night (or two, or twenty...) in the house.  While we hope that our cows take care of their own calves, and the goats their own kids, sometimes things happen!  Plus, with all the poultry we've raised, chasing baby chicks around inside the house got old.  After having chickens in the basement in kiddie pools and a calf in the upstairs bathroom, Margaret decided it was time to set aside a more appropriate space for those occasions.</p>
<p>The baby pen is extremely simple: a box built in our tuck-under garage, on a concrete floor, in which we could keep chickens, goats, or calves when they're sick or otherwise need attention.  Margaret got a few 4ftx8ft OSB panels, some leftover 4x4s and 2x4s, and framed a simple 6ftx8ft pen in the corner of the garage.  An 8ftx10ft tarp can be easily laid out on the floor and tacked up the walls a bit, to keep manure off the concrete.  She built shelves over one end for storage, and installed some hooks so heat lamps for young poultry could be hung safely.  When necessary, it can also be subdivided with a few minutes of work, some leftover panel scraps, and some screws.</p>
