<h1>Beer Bread</h1><br>
A quick, easy, and delicious way to use up that cheap junky beer you had
to have around for that last football party!<br>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul><li>3 c self-rising flour<sup>*</sup></li>
<li>0.5 c sugar</li>
<li>12 oz beer, any kind</li>
<li>0.25-0.5 stick butter</li></ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol><li>Preheat oven to 350<sup>o</sup>F. Grease and flour a large loaf pan.</li>
<li>Mix dry ingredients together in a large bowl.</li>
<li>Add beer to dry ingredients and mix well into a sticky dough.</li>
<li>Pour dough into loaf pan, and bake for 45 min.</li>
<li>After 45 min, melt the butter and pour over the top of the bread.  Return to oven for another 15 min.</li>
<li>Remove from oven, allow to cool, then flip pan over to release bread.  Try to let it completely cool before cutting...it's hard to resist but it makes cutting easier!</li></ol>

<sup>*</sup>If you don't have self-rising flour, use the following:
<ul><li>3 c all-purporse flour</li>
<li>4.5 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>0.75 tsp salt</li></ul>
