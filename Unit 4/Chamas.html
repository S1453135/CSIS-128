<h1>Margaret Chamas</h1>
<p>Hey all!  I'm Margaret, and I have a pretty wide and random set of 
favorite activities and hobbies.  I've been a geek for most of my life, 
but in addition to "usual" geek things like video gaming and reading 
fantasy and sci-fi novels,  my friends and I used to beat each other up 
with wooden swords.  So in high school I took up fencing, and in college 
joined a theatrical combat troupe.  On a totally different track, I'm an 
"aspiring" farmer; I grew up with dairy goats and chickens, expanded to 
beef cows in college and grad school, and now I finally have a hobby farm 
to play around with.  And on yet another different track, I'm a runner, 
training for my second marathon at the moment (two weeks away!).  I run 
trail and road races, as well as mud and obstacle course races.</p>
