		<td>In a 1930s-era retelling of Homer's "Odyssey", a trio of escaped 
		convicts try to find buried treasure and ultimately get back "home," 
		despite pursuit by a lawman.  Along the way they encounter a man who 
		will "give you money if you sing in his can," a lynch mob, sirens, 
		horse-eating hillbillies, feuding governors on the campaign trail, a 
		"geographical oddity," a bank robber, and more.</td>
